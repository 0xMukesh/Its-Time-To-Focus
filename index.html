    <p class="info lead body">It's Time To Focus was originally created by <a class="link"
        href="https://github.com/Kira272921">Kira</a>, while he was bored sitting in room wondering how can he kill his
      time, surfing through his discord mentions<br>He saw that most of his discord friends where struggling to stay
      focused during this online study age, at this specific moment an idea struck into his mind of making a web
      application which helps the students<br>He opened Visual Studio Code and created a file named
      <code>index.html</code> and this
      was the birth of It's Time To Focus<br> "It's Time To Focus" originally started with a simple basic clock on
      the
      homepage and eventually new features were added such as Pomodoro clock, To-do list, Lofi Music player and many
      more feature will be coming... ðŸ”¥
